*Black Square (After Malevich)*

In synchronicity, sirens spin throughout the city at various frequencies. One low on 21st Street heading west. One high on 3rd Avenue going south. Both leaving Doppler wakes at all observable locations â€” recorded and echoed by a matrix of black vertical glass. The Terms have a way of always catching up. 

Half a zip code high, surrounded by a cocoon of right angles, the rebel entrepreneur stands looking down on 5th Avenue ants from floor-to-ceiling corporate eyes, reciting sacred patterns 2, 8, 18, 32, 24, 8, 2. Parachutes are packed into the janitor's closet surrounded by shrinking office space and expanding servers. Downstairs black cars are parked idling, carbon dioxide seductively leaking into the air. The muscle sneers, "don't be jealous."

*Interference*

RAID sirens spinning. So hot. Cool on the way down except for the updrafts. The widening gyre and whatnot. Plastic confetti rains down into the depths of the sea as sharks mysteriously attack decaying cables transmitting information theory at the speed of entropy. For 23 days earth's fellow traveler transmits empty dispatches in two streams of inane radio beeps. Meanwhile, coral is evacuated en masse by its microbial hosts, then pulverized into the great sinking columns, swaying in limestone history. 

Two options in the back of an ambulance. None of them theoretical. They brought cameras to film the proletariat and found no words only shy smiles. Man-on-the-street style. What can *I* say about capitalism? There's no time in the back of an ambulance.
