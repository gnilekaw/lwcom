This shot was taken near the silver mine that established the town in the early 1500s. In the upper left background is a reconstructed guard tower and to the right of the bell tower you can see the scaffolding for the Svornost mine elevator.

The mine's elevator is operated with this lever. Buzz five times to go up. Four to go down. And one to stop when you see the floor.
