title: Rod and Gun Club
---

HD video, 19 minutes, 2015.

_Rod and Gun Club_, set in Palenville, NY, opens with a historical marker informing passers-by that road 23A follows the fictional path of Rip Van Winkle and his dog Wolf. After this whimsical detail, the sign adds that road 23A, during the years 1914 through 1921, was build with prison labor.

Once home to Hanne Arendt, Palenville is now home to the likes of the Rip Van Winkle Rod and Gun Club, which hosts an annual crow hunt. "Crow Down," as the club markets the event, is a family-friendly affair in which participants shoot as many crows as possible, with the winner taking home a brand new shotgun.

_Rod and Gun Club_, at 19 minutes long, is primarily composed of one long shot. From the point of view of the car's windshield the film winds along Palenville's wooded back roads, eventually arriving at the club's headquarters, which is guarded by police and protested by two lone activists in red jackets.

Twice, an off-camera voice gives context to the events that otherwise unfold in real time without explanation. "It's billed as a family event," the narrator says, "and we're hoping to get access to their clubhouse."
